# 🔓 SQL Breach Simulation Environment  
A simulated SQL breach environment designed for **incident response**, **forensics**, and **database security testing**.  
This project replicates common SQL attack patterns such as weak authentication, exposed tables, misconfigured permissions, and insecure queries.

## 🚀 Features
✔ Simulated user database with intentional vulnerabilities  
✔ Weak password hashing (MD5) for analysis  
✔ Suspicious login attempt logs  
✔ Deliberately misconfigured permissions  
✔ SQL injection-vulnerable query examples  
✔ Breach timeline simulation for defenders  
✔ Includes attacker + defender POV data
